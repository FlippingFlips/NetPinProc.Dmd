## NetPinProc.Dmd
--
For P-ROC boards with a (DMD) display controller. Dot Matrix Display controllers and frame management.

This was taken from the main library because it cannot be used by a P3-ROC. The main controller requires an `IGameController` implentation from `NetPinProc.Domain`.

## Main classes
---

- DmdDisplayController.cs
- ScoreDisplay.cs
- Fonts
- Transitions
